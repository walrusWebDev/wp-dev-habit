## Daily Log: 10/25/2025

### What was the main theme or project you focused on today?
Local WordPress development with a thin client and a local server, setting up the ideal workflow

### What was the single biggest task you completed?
Separating environments for each project with distinct docker yaml files in -local directories with the plugin folders attached as volumes. Also added backups, redundancy - saving backups on both machines, and a cron to run every day to save, every month to clean up.

### Describe a significant challenge or problem you encountered.
GitHub and Docker are not intuitive to me, so there was a lot of back and forth with the yaml files and I needed step by step guidance with getting the SSH setup on the local server.

### How did you approach solving it? What was your thought process?
I searched for the info I needed an created Wiki pages with notes for future use.

### What's something new you learned today? (A tool, a technique, a concept)
I know that docker compose down -v will stop a container and delete its data, so when it comes up again, it will start the wp install from the welcome screen

### What's one thing you're proud of from today's work?
The local environment is much improved. Now I can start my work locally, push plugin work to a repo, and see it updated instantly in the local WordPress project.

### Based on today, what is the most important priority for tomorrow?
Tomorrow I want to document some things and then get started on revamping a large project, taking full advantage of the new local dev environment.
