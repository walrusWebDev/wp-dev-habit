A simple, elegant tool that asks you probing questions about your daily work to help you generate content, document your progress, and maintain a consistent journal.

## Description
WP Dev Habit is a lightweight WordPress plugin designed for developers, creators, marketers, and anyone who needs to document their journey. It adds a simple page to your WordPress admin area with a guided form. By answering a series of thought-provoking questions about your day, you generate a well-structured log.

### This log can be used as:
- A private daily work journal.
- The foundation for a public blog post.
- A progress report for your team or clients.
- A tool to combat writer's block.
The core idea is to turn the often-neglected task of documentation into a simple, rewarding daily habit.

### Installation
- Upload the wp-dev-habit folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
- Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
- Find the WP Dev Habit page in your admin menu and start journaling!

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Can I customize the questions?
Not yet, but this is a planned feature for a future version.

### Where is the data stored?
Currently, the tool generates text that you can copy to your clipboard. It does not yet save entries to the database. This is planned for a future release to allow for private journaling and draft creation.

### Is this plugin free?
Yes, WP Dev Habit is free and open-source.

### Changelog
